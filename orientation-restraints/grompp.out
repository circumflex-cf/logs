Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 2.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 2.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 72x48x64, spacing 0.112 0.117 0.116
This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
